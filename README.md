FitTrack is a web-based platform designed to help users manage their exercise and health routines, providing personalized tracking and AI-powered recommendations. The platform allows athletes to track their progress, receive automatic training adjustments, and connect with professionals who design personalized plans.

Given its scope, the system will be based on a microservices architecture, with each key feature being an independent service, facilitating scalability, maintenance, and cloud deployment.
